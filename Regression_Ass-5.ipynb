    "##### Multicollinearity:\n",

Positive or negative signs indicate the direction of the relationship, and the magnitude reflects the strength. Due to regularization, coefficients may be shrunk towards zero, and those reaching zero imply variable exclusion. The interpretation is influenced by the alpha parameter, balancing between L1 and L2 regularization, and Elastic Net's automatic feature selection enhances model interpretability."

    "\n",
    "Select Elastic Net Regression as your regression model. Elastic Net combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, and the balance between these two penalties is controlled by the hyperparameter alpha.\n",
    "##### Tune the Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with different values of the alpha parameter. Higher alpha values (closer to 1) increase the likelihood of sparsity in the model, leading to more coefficients being driven to zero. The optimal alpha value depends on the specific characteristics of your data.\n",
    "##### Fit the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit the Elastic Net model on your training data using the chosen alpha value. The model will automatically perform feature selection during the training process.\n",
    "##### Inspect Coefficients:\n",
    "#### Get the coefficients\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Identify features with non-zero coefficients\n",
    "selected_features = X_train.columns[coefficients != 0]\n",

    "##### Evaluate Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics on a validation or test set. Ensure that the selected features contribute to a predictive and generalizable model.\n"
